# Horse Knowledge Quiz

## For this challenge, we were tasked with writing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a 5 question quiz. I chose to have the content of this quiz be questions about horses and horse items. There was no starter code so I had to built this quiz from the ground up. The start page needed a title, definition of the quiz, a start button, a timer, and a "view high scores" link which would take you to the high scores page. Once the start button was clicked, the start page should disappear and the first question was supposed to pop up. As each question was answered, a new question is supposed to pop up. Once the last question was answered, an all done page was supposed to pop up. Here, you would enter your initals and submit them. On the high scores page, there is a button to go backk to the start page and a buitton to clear the high scores.
